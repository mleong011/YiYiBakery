# YiYi Bakery

Mary Leong
Landing Page for YiYi BAKERY:
https://mleong011.github.io/YiYiBakery/index.html

The design of this website will be simple and start off by showcasing popular bakery items and allowing people to make orders on buns. It will include links to social media sites that will be started to show new and popular items and allow customers to post their purchases and gain an online following.

Includes 4 separate html files:
Index.html
Menu.html
Cart.html
AboutUs.html

I used one CSS file for all pages: active.CSS

I am new to javascript and was having some issues adding all functionalities for
the buttons.

I found some online tutorials about adding in functional buttons on youtube.
The remove from cart button does work.
